### Let's understand how our current financial system works

Let's say I want to send an image to my friend John. I can copy paste image into a platform and I'm done. John has an image and I have a copy 
of an image as well. What if instead of image, I want to send money to John? It doesn't make sense that I sent him money yet I get to
keep a copy of money as well. This is called **double spend** problem. To fix the issue, we require a **centralized** entity between John and me, for example financial instituition
or a bank to validate that I sent money to John and delete the balance from my account. This centralized entity is very important
in traditional finance (**TradeFi**) for the above reason.

### What's the problem with these centralized authorities?

We need to **trust** the centralized entity not just to store our money (savings) but also for transactions. Banks and financial instituions
have too much power over the economy that it has led to the financial crisis of 2008. Bitcoin is created as a response to this.
To make the whole system **trustless**. There's no centralized authority that can toy with our money as they please that will ultimately
put common man like us on the streets.

### Why BTC has any value?

Lot of folks think of BTC as something people buy so that they can sell later at a higher price. BTC would have crashed hard if that's the 
reason why it has value. Look up tons of assets created on daily basis as they lose value not just in crypto but in stocks as well. A lots of 
narratives are going around saying that Bitcoin is digital gold or 21th century's gold or Bitcoin is sound money. Well that is true once you
understand it, but the real reason why the demand outweights supply is much different. Bitcoin as an asset, doesn't care about your religion,
your opinions, your financial status. It doesn't show any biases towards anyone. Anyone can create a wallet (their ownbank) within a matter
of minutes and you can do transactions. It's completely trustless and isn't **controlled by any single entity**. When you own BTC, it's truly yours,
the bank, the government can't confiscate from you because they feel like it. The bank or any authority can't stop you from transacting because you
exceeded some limit. When people understand this, any asset class pales in comparison to what BTC has to offer. Imagine a scenario of war, your
real estate will either get destroyed or forcefully taken, gold confiscated, fiat becomes worthless. What if I told you there's an asset class
that can let you store your wealth just by remembering certain words? Yes, that's right. War is an extreme scenario but there's a reason why
Ukraine government has made it legal to hold crypto days before war. BTC as an asset is unrivalled and it truly belongs to you and self
custodial. No one can take it away from what's yours. People who understand that Bitcoin is freedom money will always end up buying BTC, hence 
demand outweights supply. People are giving BTC the value due to the freedom it offers, 1BTC is always 1BTC. Scarcity, Fungibility, Transportability 
over time and space, Reliability, Divisibility, and Universal availability. No other medium of transaction, whether it be fiat currency or gold,
can match Bitcoin in all of those categories.

### Why the stress on decentralization?

Let's take the recent example of Canada Trucker's issue. The truckers were peacefully protesting, though it's normal for government to take some
action against the protestors as it's affecting Canada's supply chain, their president straight up declared a National Emergency. They freezed 
bank accounts of all the truckers along with the people who supported them from gofundme. They didn't stop with that, they also freezed accounts of family members
of both protestors as well as supporters. If my cousin supported the protestors by donating 5$, that would have lead to my bank account freezed.
Guess what Canadians started buying? Yes, Bitcoin. That was probably a eureka moment for lots of Canadians. While the governments are busy
unbanking the banked, Bitcoin lives up to it's name by banking the unbanked.  Turkey's inflation rose to 36% last year alone because their currency 
is in the hands of central authority aka government. Venezuela is one extreme example of how one single government can lead to collapse of an entire economy.

### But fiat has value and you can buy stuff with it. You can't with BTC

This is a fair argument. If you know stocks, to mint something, you always need something as collateral. To understand it better, think of
how you buy digital gold from your stock broker. They will have a reserve of gold with them which they can sell but can't sell beyond their 
reserve. Every unit of digital gold offered is backed by equal amounts of gold. Historically, to print fiat, governments needed gold, but this has long 
stopped since forever. Governments can print as much as they want out of thin air. Infact, the Federal Reserve of USA printed 50% more 
fiat than currently in circulation last year leading to heavy inflation numbers that we haven't seen in over 40years. Fiat is purely a faith based 
system, where you trust the government that it has value. Bitcoin is a faith system where you value freedom and see value in peer to peer 
transactions that can't be stopped/controlled by anything. A ban on bitcoin doesn't mean anything since it's decentralized. Countries have tried
for over a decade but failed. Now we have a country which made BTC legal tender, multiple US counties/ LATAM countries have submitted bills 
to make BTC legal tender. 

### Why countries/banks don't want BTC?


Governments like power. They always hated what they can't control. And BTC is exactly that. The government can always wake you up in the middle
of night, confiscate all your assets and you will be on the roads very next day. While the possibility of this is low, but it can happen. You will
understand how in the next section

### What is CBDC?

CBDC aka Central Bank Digital Currency is a centralized shitcoin that countries are trying to push for. They leverage the tech from current
blockchains and created their own version of blockchain. This version of blockchain can control everything. Imagine you trying to buy some wine,
government can restrict you from transaction since you bought more than what they deemed is limit. If Canada had CBDC in place, freezing accounts
would have taken minutes instead of days. Governments can freeze your accounts if you disagree with their political view. This will cause lots of
problems with elections as well since current government can stop opposing parties from doing transactions claiming technical issues. To put simply, 
your every transaction will be monited and government has the "destroy his life" button on the fingers which they can click anytime.
A lot of people are uneducated on these matters and they will simply accept for what is to come. There's already huge discussion of this in US
but chances are, a lot of third world countries will shove this dystopain tech into our throats and the only people who stand against this will
have their accounts freezed or made 0. Whether you believe it will happen or not is upto you, nobody thought we would see a war, nobody thought
their bank accounts would be frozen by the so called civilized western country and here we are. I personally don't like to be controlled, we are not sheep. 
Here's a great [thread on how freedom of transaction](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1494444624630403083) is directly linked to other human rights.
Technologies have always made things faster and easier. in CBDC's case it's something undesirable. Imagine supporting
farmers who are protesting and instantly getting your accounts freezed. It just simply makes people with power more powerful.

### Final Thoughts

For the above reasons, I strongly believe some countries will continue cracking on BTC. But I do feel there will be legal tender safe spaces which
offer citizenship (like El Salvador). A parallel systems will be built to push back, as these centralized currencies become obselete and decentralized
alternatives become a reality. I do not recomment buying BTC or any digital asset for that matter unless you understand it. But in my opinion,  Bitcoin 
is more of a hedge against current mindless monetary policies, instituitions, banks and most of all governments.
